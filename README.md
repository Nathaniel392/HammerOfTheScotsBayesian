Before you make changes, check which branch you are on (right above the list of files). If you're on master, click the branch selector and make a new branch. This will create a copy of all the code on your previous branch that you can edit without affecting the master branch. When you have finished committing your changes, create a pull request. See the Wiki for more information about branching.

fix pillage output for healing*
  instead of sending the heal function the number of points it wants, start a loop that executes the # of times it wants the     healing points sent and outputs each time it's healed once*
    or, just fix output to do the actual # it was healed*


seems like there's one less movement than card played ??

change computer passing probability to something much lower

sea move allowed it to move to a neutral region*

random_region might be wrong
