Before you make changes, check which branch you are on (right above the list of files). If you're on master, click the branch selector and make a new branch. This will create a copy of all the code on your previous branch that you can edit without affecting the master branch. When you have finished committing your changes, create a pull request. See the Wiki for more information about branching.

Welcome to the Hammer of the Scots bayesian computer opponent. To run this program
you need to have python installed on your device or computer. There are many
tutorials online that will help you do this so I will not get into the specifics
of that in this. The run the actual program you need to make sure that all of
the files provided here are in the same directory. If you are on MAC you need to
change your directory to the directory in which all the files are stored in using
the 'cd' command. Next you should run the command python3 (or just python)
play_game.py. This file is the main file that imports all of the other aspects of
the game. The play_game file also runs through the general structure of the code. 
Within the play_game.py file there are a few lines towards the top of the play_
game function that allow you to decide whether you want a computer to play
another computer or a computer to play a human. There are also options on which
side you want to play each role (ENGLAND or SCOTLAND) in the game. To slow down
the computer output in computer vs. computer you should utilize the toggle_
input file that is within the directory. In that file you should uncomment the
input() statements to allow the user to dictate how quickly the computers
make their sequential movements. Overall this program is still a work in
progress and if you are using it you may run into different bugs or issues
that we have not caught yet.
